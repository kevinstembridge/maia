# Maia Framework

Maia is a framework for building full-stack web applications or microservices 
based on a Kotlin, Angular, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL tech stack.

## Why?

Spring Boot is a fantastic framework. It saves us so much time by doing so 
much of the generic stuff that is not specific to the business functionality
of our applications. But even so, we still have a lot of generic work
to do.

Maia adds on top of what Spring Boot provides. It aims to get you closer to
the point where you don't have to write generic code and can focus more of
your effort on the business logic of your application.

## How?

At the heart of Maia is a code generator. That's already going to put a lot of 
people off because code generators are unloved. Even the Spring 
Boot documentation proudly states that their framework contains "Absolutely 
no code generation". But this framework embraces it. To understand
why we think the good outweighs the bad, see our discussion in 
the [Code Generation](code_generation/code_generation.md) section.

See the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) section to begin creating your first application.
