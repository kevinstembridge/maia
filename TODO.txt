TODO * Maia Showcase
    TODO * Add UI to showcase
        TODO * Try to create a npm package to contain common UI components. e.g. message-detail

    TODO * Remove all dependencies and add back in as needed, the goal is for application modules to not have to declare
        a dependency on something that Maia needs.
