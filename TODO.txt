TODO * Maia Showcase
    TODO * Delete redundant tests and samples. e.g. SampleJdbcSpec
TODO * Rename maia-webapp-endpoints to maia-webapp-web-layer, service-layer
TODO * Remove all dependencies and add back in as needed, the goal is for application modules to not have to declare
    a dependency on something that Maia needs.
